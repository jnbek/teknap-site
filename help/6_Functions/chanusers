Synopsis:
   $chanusers([<channel>|*])

Technical:
   This function returns a list of users currently on the specified channel.
   It will only operate for channels that the client is currently on.

Practical:
   This function basically does the same thing as NAMES, except is much
   faster.  However, it only functions on the client's current channels.
   If no channel is specified, the current is used.  

Returns:
   list of nicknames on specified channel, or nothing if error

Examples:
   $onchannel()                  shows users on current channel
   $onchannel(foobar)            shows users on foobar if client is there
